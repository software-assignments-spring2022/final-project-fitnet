This is the main page of the app, once the user has logged in. The social media feed is present, and the bottom task bar contains buttons for a new post, home, profile, and settings from left to right. The new post screen allows users to post things to the site, and the profile allows for customization as well as links to the workout history and playlists.

## Settings
