## Building and testing 
* `npm install ` will install all dependencies listen in the `package.json` file
* `npm start` is one way to start the server - it will require you to manually restart whenever you change the code
* install `nodemon` by doing `npm install -g nodemon`
* `nodemon server` will start up the server with a monitoring process that will stop and restart the server automatically anytime code is changed
