Isaac Singer â€” Yesterday at 8:52 PM

Vanessa Chen â€” Yesterday at 8:54 PM

if u were then add, commit, then do git push origin [branch-name] 
and u should be able to create a pull request on github

Also, here is the logo svg
Colin McRae â€” Yesterday at 10:26 PM
I think it'll be easier to work with if it's wider than it is tall but it's good either way
Isaac Singer â€” Yesterday at 10:26 PM
Ok, i can see what i can do
btw
just download the svg
it is a vectorized version of the logo
Colin McRae â€” Yesterday at 10:28 PM
I'll worry about the logo later, I'm gonna focus on my pages for now
Isaac Singer â€” Yesterday at 10:29 PM
How about this
Image
which one do yall like better
Colin McRae â€” Yesterday at 10:29 PM
Second
Isaac Singer â€” Yesterday at 10:29 PM
Dope
Anything else
Honestly I agree btw
as I said, I am kinda shit at design, I just know how to open stuff in inkskape
Yousuf Kidwai â€” Yesterday at 10:31 PM
looks fuego
Isaac Singer â€” Yesterday at 10:33 PM
How does this final logo look

Colin McRae â€” Yesterday at 10:34 PM

Agree
now we have the blue for when it is a white background
Colin McRae â€” Yesterday at 10:37 PM
lovely
Isaac Singer â€” Yesterday at 10:37 PM
I think it looks dope tbh ðŸ˜€
Colin McRae â€” Yesterday at 10:38 PM
I'm not too sure how to use svg but as long as you can handle that I'll learn later
Isaac Singer â€” Yesterday at 10:38 PM
src="logo.svg"
just like
src="logo.png"
loads in chrome
and all browsers
try it yourself
download the svg and open it in chrome
that way it has the perfect level of resolution at all sizes
Colin McRae â€” Yesterday at 10:39 PM
again, just gonna focus on my pages for now
Isaac Singer â€” Yesterday at 10:40 PM
sure, that's fine, just wanted to answer your question just in case any one else wanted an idea on how to use it
also, anyone can edit it using inkscape if wanted
Yousuf Kidwai â€” Yesterday at 10:49 PM
im about to push login it was pretty simple just need to style it
and then forgot password should also be pretty simple too
id imagine the styling for all three pages will be pretty much the same
Yousuf Kidwai â€” Yesterday at 11:02 PM
@Vanessa Chen i think the merges mightve got messed up
hold on actually maybe i can fix myself from my end
Vanessa Chen â€” Yesterday at 11:02 PM
okay
i'm going to style newpost
Yousuf Kidwai â€” Yesterday at 11:04 PM
fixed it
Vanessa Chen â€” Yesterday at 11:04 PM
great
Yousuf Kidwai â€” Yesterday at 11:04 PM
do you need help with styling?
i could give it a shot if needed
Vanessa Chen â€” Yesterday at 11:04 PM
did you make both login and forgot password
Yousuf Kidwai â€” Yesterday at 11:08 PM
nah just login
i mightve made the file for forgotpassword but havent written frontend yet
Vanessa Chen â€” Yesterday at 11:09 PM
okay work on that first
Isaac Singer â€” Yesterday at 11:09 PM
I am working on the home page again to link to the sign up and log in page
Colin McRae â€” Yesterday at 11:16 PM
there are so many freaking layers to the add workout/exercise page that I keep finding
Isaac Singer â€” Yesterday at 11:20 PM
Do you want a hand on that
Colin McRae â€” Yesterday at 11:20 PM
if you have the time, sure
Isaac Singer â€” Yesterday at 11:20 PM
dope
Vanessa Chen â€” Yesterday at 11:39 PM
i'm going to work on workouthistory
so we have the workout history page
has anyone worked on the actual workout playlist page
like showing the exercises in the workout
Colin McRae â€” Yesterday at 11:42 PM
I'm working on that
it's tedious
Vanessa Chen â€” Yesterday at 11:43 PM
okay great
i think you need to have a unique id for each workout
Colin McRae â€” Yesterday at 11:43 PM
I can show you what I have so far if you wanna hop in VC
Vanessa Chen â€” Yesterday at 11:43 PM
sure
Vanessa Chen â€” Today at 12:43 AM
