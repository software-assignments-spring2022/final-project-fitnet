# Guide to Contributing

## Team Norms 

Please make sure that you are following our [team norms](./team-norms.md) before making any contributions. 

## Rules of contributing 
These are the same rules listed in our [coding standards](./team-norms.md).  
- Don't over-engineer. Write minimum code to get things working end to end, only then iterate to improve. 
- Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
- Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix.
- Provide descriptive commit messages.
- Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
- Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it.
- Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality.
